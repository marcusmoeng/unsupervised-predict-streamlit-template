<h1>  Movie Recommendation System</h1>

A `recommendation system` is a subclass of information filtering system
   that seek to predict the `rating` or `preference` a user would give to an item.
    They are primarily used in commercial applications.
    Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as
    playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product
    recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms
    such as Facebook and Twitter. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or
    multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are
    also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender
    systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators,
    and financial services. The primary recommender system models are Content based filtering and
    collaborative based filtering.
